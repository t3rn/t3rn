# How to contribute to t3rn

Thank you for contributing to t3rn!

This is a short guide on how to contribute to t3rn's codebase. The first sections are specific scenarios you might find yourself in. The final sections provide more information on how to write the issues and format code.

---

### Did you find a bug?

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**. Instead, report it directly to our [email](emailto:team@t3rn.io).

- **Ensure the issue was not already reported** by searching on the repository under [Issues](https://github.com/t3rn/t3rb/issues). The page allows you to narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/t3rn/t3rn/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

- If possible, use the relevant report [templates](#templates-and-guidelines) to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into the corresponding file or text area, and make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug/issue?

- Head over to [Github](https://github.com/t3rn/t3rn/pulls) and open a new pull request with the patch.

- Ensure that you **clearly describe the problem** and solution in the PR description. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- **Before submitting**, please read the section [guidelines](#templates-and-guidelines) below to know more about conventions.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- You can fork the repository, create a new branch (name it starting with `feature/` so it's easier to identify), and code your new feature. When you finish, write a [pull request](#pull-requests) to merge your code.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

- Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the codebase will not have high priority.

## Guidelines and templates

Here you can find the guidelines for writing commits, and the templates for reporting issues, and writing pull requests (PRs).

---

### Commits

We follow a couple of conventions that very easy to implement in your workflow.

#### Formatting

When working with Rust code, you should always format it using `cargo`. Before commiting the code, this command formats the codebase and fixes problematic stuff:

    cargo fmt && cargo fix --allow-dirty --allow-staged

#### Conventional Commits

When commiting, commit messages must adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) guidelines. Here's a short overview of how a commit message should be:

    <type>[optional scope]: <description>

    [optional body]

    [optional footer(s)]

There are some *types* that are accepted: `fix`, `feat`, `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`.

**Note**: `<type>`, `<scope>`, and `<description>` are always in lowercase letters. Capital letters will break CI.

---

### Issues

There are several templates for opening an issue in our Github repository.
Currently, we allow these types of issues:
- Bug report
- Feature request
- Backlog item

Go to [Issues](https://github.com/t3rn/t3rn/issues), [open a new one](https://github.com/t3rn/t3rn/issues/new/choose) by selecting the type you would like to report, and fill the information in the template.

---

### Pull requests

When submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/t3rn/t3rn/pulls), the repository has already the template to [fill it](https://github.com/t3rn/t3rn/compare). Also, you can copy-paste the following and complete it in a web browser:

    # Summary of changes

    **Summarize** the description of your changes. 

    If it fixes a bug or creates a feature, link the issue.

    ## Acceptance Checklist
