## Getting Started with t3rn:

1. **Participate as an Executor or Attester:**
   - Join the network as an [Executor](executor/executor-overview) to process transactions or as an Attester to validate them. Engage in the ecosystem by bidding on orders, executing transactions, and submitting attestations.
1. **Explore t3rn's swap UI:**
   - Explore cross-chain swaps with our intuitive [Swap UI](https://bridge.t1rn.io/). Now live on testnets, it enables fast, secure, and cost-efficient cross-chain transactions.

## Core of t3rn's Modular Stack

1. **Enhanced Security with Trustless Validation:**
   - t3rn maintains high security and trustless validations through Rangers. These specialized participants continuously monitor connected blockchains, submitting the latest block headers to the t3rn Circuit.
1. **Multichain Smart Contract Executions:**
   - t3rn enables smart contracts to perform transactions across multiple blockchain networks, ensuring fail-safe operations and expanded functionality.
1. **Support for Multiple Languages:**
   - Developers can write smart contracts in Solidity, !ink, or any language that compiles to WASM. t3rn supports both WASM and EVM, offering versatility in development.
1. **Open-Source Registry:**
   - Smart contracts on t3rn are stored in an open-source registry, making them accessible for reuse and development by the broader community.
1. **Remuneration for Creators:**
   - Contract creators are [rewarded](/tokenomics#gas-fees) each time their code is executed, receiving a share of the gas fee. This incentivizes open-source development and fosters a new paradigm of collaborative creation.
