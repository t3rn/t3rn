## Getting Started with t3rn:

1. **Participate as an Executor:**
   - Join the network as an [Executor](executor/executor-overview) to process transactions and engage in the ecosystem by bidding on orders and executing transactions.
1. **Explore t3rn's Bridge UI:**
   - Explore cross-chain swaps with our intuitive [Bridge UI](https://bridge.t1rn.io/). Now live on testnets, it enables fast, secure, and cost-efficient cross-chain transactions.

## Core of t3rn's Modular Stack

1. **Execution & Settlement**
   - Cross-chain transactions are executed and settled on L2s or target chains, utilizing their scalability and cost-efficiency. This process ensures swift execution followed by definitive settlement, updating balances and recording outcomes on the blockchainâ€™s ledger.
1. **Consensus**
   - t3rn leverages Polkadotâ€™s consensus supported by light clients for secure, interoperable transactions. Light clients enable t3rn to validate cross-chain data efficiently on Polkadot, enhancing trust and reducing resources.
1. **Attestations**
   - Attestor and staking setup is deployed on Arbitrum L2. Coupled with light client plugins for Ethereum, streamlines t3rnâ€™s infrastructure, offering a plug-and-play solution for cross-chain transactions and preventing any execution bottlenecks effectively.
1. **Intent Execution**
   - Executors in the t3rn ecosystem carry out cross-chain transactions on interconnected L1 and L2 solutions or target chains, leveraging the specific benefits of each for efficient and secure execution.
