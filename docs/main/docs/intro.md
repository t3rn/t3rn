Welcome to t3rn, the Universal Execution Protocol designed for coordinating smart contracts, capital, and computation across ecosystems without complexity, delay, or risk. t3rn enables any smart contract to run across multiple blockchains, both EVM and non-EVM, instantly and atomically, with no need for fragile bridges or complex integrations.

## What is t3rn?

At its core, t3rn is a Universal Execution Protocol where smart contracts and executions have no boundaries. To achieve this we are building a protocol where smart contracts operate across all chains, atomically, and with full composability, enabling decentralized applications, agents, and protocols to coordinate without fragmentation or custom integration overhead.

With t3rn, you can:

- Bridge assets across networks.
- Perform secure, crosschain smart contract executions.
- Provide liquidity for crosschain transactions as an Executor.
- Participate in a growing ecosystem with governance and rewards.

## Why Use t3rn?

- **Crosschain Integration**: t3rn removes the complexities of working across multiple blockchain networks, making crosschain interactions as simple as interacting on a single chain.
- **Guaranteed Security**: Built with an optimized approach, t3rn guarantees transaction security by using fail-safe mechanisms like rolling back unsuccessful crosschain transactions.
- **Reward Opportunities**: Liquidity providers, known as Executors, earn fees for facilitating crosschain transactions, making t3rn a rewarding platform for active participants.

## Getting Started with t3rn:

1. **Participate as an Executor:**
   - Join the network as an [Executor](executor/executor-overview) to process transactions and engage in the ecosystem by bidding on orders and executing transactions.
1. **Explore t3rn's Bridge UI:**
   - Explore crosschain swaps with our intuitive [Bridge UI](https://bridge.t2rn.io/). Now live on testnets, it enables fast, secure, and cost-efficient crosschain transactions.
