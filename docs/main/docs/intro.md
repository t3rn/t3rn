# Getting Started

Welcome to t3rn, a smart contract hosting platform designed for seamless and fail-safe multichain executions. t3rn is uniquely positioned to bridge the gaps in blockchain interoperability, offering developers and users alike a flexible and efficient environment for blockchain interactions.

## Core Features of t3rn

1. **Enhanced Security with Trustless Validation:**
   - t3rn maintains high security and trustless validations through Rangers. These specialized participants continuously monitor connected blockchains, submitting the latest block headers to the t3rn Circuit.
1. **Multichain Smart Contract Executions:**
   - t3rn enables smart contracts to perform transactions across multiple blockchain networks, ensuring fail-safe operations and expanded functionality.
1. **Support for Multiple Languages:**
   - Developers can write smart contracts in Solidity, !ink, or any language that compiles to WASM. t3rn supports both WASM and EVM, offering versatility in development.
1. **Open-Source Registry:**
   - Smart contracts on t3rn are stored in an open-source registry, making them accessible for reuse and development by the broader community.
1. **Remuneration for Creators:**
   - Contract creators are [rewarded](/tokenomics#gas-fees) each time their code is executed, receiving a share of the gas fee. This incentivizes open-source development and fosters a new paradigm of collaborative creation.

## Key Network Participants

To facilitate its multichain transactions, t3rn relies on essential network participants:

1. **Executors:**
   - Executors play a crucial role in processing cross-chain transactions. They assess, bid on, and execute orders created by users, ensuring efficient transaction completion.
1. **Attesters:**
   - Attesters are responsible for verifying the correctness and completion of cross-chain transactions. They submit attestations that are crucial for the validation and finalization of transactions.
1. **Collator:**
   - Callators in the t3rn ecosystem are vital for facilitating cross-chain communication and transactions. They relay transaction information between chains, ensuring accurate and efficient execution of cross-chain calls.

## Getting Started with t3rn:

1. **Collator Node Operation:**
   - To participate in the t3rn network, you can set up and run a collator node. This involves installing the software, configuring settings, and syncing with the desired network (e.g., t2rn, t0rn, t1rn, or t3rn).
1. **Smart Contract Development:**
   - Develop smart contracts using Solidity or any WASM-compatible language. Deploy your contracts to t3rnâ€™s open-source registry to make them available for multichain execution and collaboration. Learn more about the [t3rn Smart Contract Hub](t3rn-protocol-wiki/smart-contract-hub).
1. **Participate as an Executor or Attester:**
   - Join the network as an Executor to process transactions or as an Attester to validate them. Engage in the ecosystem by bidding on orders, executing transactions, and submitting attestations.
1. **Explore t3rn's Capabilities:**
   - Dive into the world of cross-chain swaps, understand the functionalities of the Remote Order, EscrowGMP, and Attestations Verifier contracts, and explore how t3rn solves blockchain connections.
